## Repository and test branches information ##################

# The moodle repository where the branches are located.
# TODO: git://github.com/YOURUSER/moodle.git when MDL-41421 gets integrated
repository="git://github.com/dmonllao/moodle.git"

# The base where both before and after branches will be updated.
# This is necessary in case there are changes in
# the generators codebase between before and after, we would not
# be able to compare results as the test plan generator or the
# generated data would change, so this setting will always be
# pointing to a minor or major release hash.
#
# You don't need to change this value
# This is Moodle 2.6dev version 2013091300.00
# TODO: the weekly dev or 2.6.0 as default when MDL-41421 gets integrated.
basecommit="7d8a436317f2386b2ad3ab4dabfafdcded54f618"
# Older bases in the branch
# This is Moodle X.X.X+ version NNNNNNNNNN.NN
# basecommit="this_is_an_example_of_how_we_will_show_previous_base_commits_of_this_branch"

# The original branch.
# Usually one of Moodle's weekly released branches. You can also use a git hash here.
# TODO: master as default when MDL-41421 gets integrated.
beforebranch="MDL-41421_master"

# The branch to compare against.
# Usually your development branch or the same $beforebranch value if
# you are comparing different settings configurations. You can also use a git hash here.
# TODO: master as default when MDL-41421 gets integrated.
afterbranch="MDL-41421_master"


## Others ####################################################

# The database and dataroot backups will be stored here.
# Note that this can grow a lot depending on the test sizes you use.

# Services names to restart before each run. 
# Note that this will only work in a limited set of systems as it uses system calls like "service $servicename restart"
# You will need to restart the involved services manually.
